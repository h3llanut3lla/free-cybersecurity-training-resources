## **Important Considerations**

* **Vendor Bias:** Be aware that vendor-provided training may emphasize their own products and solutions. While this can be useful, it's essential to supplement it with broader, vendor-neutral training.
* **Hands-on Practice:** Free training is most effective when combined with hands-on practice. Consider setting up a virtual lab environment to apply what you learn.
* **Stay Updated:** The cybersecurity landscape changes rapidly. Regularly check for new free training resources and keep your skills up-to-date.
