# Certifications by Roles

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This page helps cybersecurity professionals determine the best training to boost their careers. It breaks down recommended skills and knowledge by common blue team roles (like Security Analyst, Incident Responder, Threat Hunter, or Security Engineer) so you can easily see what's most important to learn for _your_ career path. For each role, you'll find relevant training topics, certifications, and helpful resources to help you level up your skills.

## Security Analyst (Entry-Level/Junior)

### Focus

Monitoring, log analysis, threat intelligence research, and basic incident response.

### Certifications

#### **Foundational and Entry-Level**

* [**CompTIA Security+:**](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) A great starting point. It validates fundamental security knowledge and is often a prerequisite for more advanced certifications. Covers basic security concepts, threats, vulnerabilities, and security best practices.
* [**CompTIA CySA+ (Cybersecurity Analyst+):** ](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst)Specifically designed for security analysts. Focuses on security monitoring, threat detection, vulnerability management, and incident response. A very relevant certification for SOC analysts.

#### **Intermediate and Specialized**

* [**(ISC)² Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP):**](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cissp) While broader than just analysis, the CISSP demonstrates expertise in security management, including incident management, risk management, and security architecture. Highly valued, but typically requires several years of experience. More suited for senior analysts or those aspiring to management roles.

#### **GIAC certifications:**

SANS Institute offers a range of specialized certifications that can be very beneficial for analysts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
&#x20;It's important to note that SANS certifications are generally considered some of the most expensive in the industry. The cost can range significantly, from a few thousand dollars for individual certifications to tens of thousands for more comprehensive programs.&#x20;

While the quality of the training is often highly regarded, it's crucial to factor the cost into your decision and consider whether your employer will sponsor the training. There are often more affordable alternatives available, especially for foundational knowledge, so carefully weigh the benefits and costs before investing in SANS certifications.
{% endhint %}

* [**GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC):** ](https://www.giac.org/certifications/security-essentials-gsec/)Covers fundamental security concepts and skills, a good stepping stone if you don't yet have Security+.
* [**GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH):**](https://www.giac.org/certifications/certified-incident-handler-gcih/) While focused on incident handling, the skills covered are very relevant to security analysts who often play a role in incident response.

#### **Microsoft Certifications**

If you work in a Microsoft-heavy environment, certifications like the [Microsoft Certified: Security Operations Analyst Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/security-operations-analyst/?practice-assessment-type=certification) are highly relevant. This validates skills in using Microsoft security tools and services.

#### **Cloud-Specific Certifications**

For analysts working in cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP), cloud security certifications are essential.

### Helpful Resources

* **Cybersecurity Fundamentals:** Start with free introductory courses on platforms like [Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it) [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) (look for introductory courses), and [edX](https://www.edx.org/). Focus on networking basics, security concepts, and operating system fundamentals.
* **SIEM Training (Free Tiers/Trials):** Splunk (See [Trainings by Vendors](trainings-by-vendors.md) for more details) and other SIEM vendors often have free tiers or trials you can use for learning the basics of log analysis and event correlation.
* **Threat Intelligence Platforms (Free Versions/Trials):** Many threat intelligence platforms have free versions or trials that allow you to explore how threat data is collected, analyzed, and used. Research individual platforms for their offerings.
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework Resources:** Familiarize yourself with the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework). NIST provides free publications and resources on security best practices.&#x20;

## Incident Responder

### Focus

Incident handling, containment, eradication, recovery, forensics.

### Specialized Certifications

* [**GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH):**](https://www.giac.org/certifications/certified-incident-handler-gcih/) A highly respected certification that validates skills in handling security incidents. It covers incident response methodologies, threat analysis, and containment strategies. Offered by SANS Institute.
* [**EC-Council Certified Incident Handler (ECIH):** ](https://www.eccouncil.org/train-certify/ec-council-certified-incident-handler-ecih/)Focuses on the essential skills and knowledge required for effective incident handling. Covers incident response lifecycle, analysis, and mitigation techniques.&#x20;

## Threat Hunter

### Focus

Proactive threat searching, identifying advanced persistent threats (APTs), and improving security posture.

### Certifications

Certifications specifically for Threat Hunters are less common than general cybersecurity certifications, as threat hunting is often considered a specialized skill set built upon a foundation of other security knowledge. However, several certifications can significantly benefit a threat hunter by validating relevant skills and knowledge.

### **Kind of Relevant Certifications**

* [**GIAC GCIH (Certified Incident Handler):**](https://www.giac.org/certifications/certified-incident-handler-gcih/) This is often cited as a valuable certification for threat hunters, as it covers incident response methodologies and skills that are relevant to threat hunting.
* [**GIAC GCIA (Certified Intrusion Analyst):** ](https://www.giac.org/certifications/certified-intrusion-analyst-gcia/)This is recommended for its focus on network intrusion detection and analysis, which are important skills for threat hunters.
* [**GIAC GCFA (Certified Forensic Analyst):** ](https://www.giac.org/certifications/certified-forensic-analyst-gcfa/)This is seen as valuable for threat hunters who need to perform in-depth investigations and analyze digital evidence.
* [**GIAC GREM (Reverse Engineering Malware):**](https://www.giac.org/certifications/reverse-engineering-malware-grem/) This is recommended for threat hunters who need to analyze malware to understand its behavior and identify potential threats.
* **Offensive Security Certifications (**[**OSCP+**](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/)**):** These are suggested for gaining a deeper understanding of attacker tactics and techniques.

{% hint style="info" %}
[Hack The Box Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com) is rapidly developing job role paths modules, so I wouldn't be surprised if they announce a Threat Hunter path and a certification exam any time soon.
{% endhint %}

## Security Engineer

### Focus
