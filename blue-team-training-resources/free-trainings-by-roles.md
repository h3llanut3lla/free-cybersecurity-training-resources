For each role, you'll find relevant training topics, certifications, and helpful resources to help you level up your skills.

## Security Analyst (Entry-Level/Junior)

### Focus

Monitoring, log analysis, threat intelligence research, and basic incident response.

### Certifications

#### **Foundational and Entry-Level**

* [**CompTIA Security+:**](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) A great starting point. It validates fundamental security knowledge and is often a prerequisite for more advanced certifications. Covers basic security concepts, threats, vulnerabilities, and security best practices.
* [**CompTIA CySA+ (Cybersecurity Analyst+):** ](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst)Specifically designed for security analysts. Focuses on security monitoring, threat detection, vulnerability management, and incident response. A very relevant certification for SOC analysts.

#### **Intermediate and Specialized**

* [**(ISC)² Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP):**](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cissp) While broader than just analysis, the CISSP demonstrates expertise in security management, including incident management, risk management, and security architecture. Highly valued, but typically requires several years of experience. More suited for senior analysts or those aspiring to management roles.

#### **GIAC certifications:**

SANS Institute offers a range of specialized certifications that can be very beneficial for analysts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
&#x20;It's important to note that SANS certifications are generally considered some of the most expensive in the industry. The cost can range significantly, from a few thousand dollars for individual certifications to tens of thousands for more comprehensive programs.&#x20;

While the quality of the training is often highly regarded, it's crucial to factor the cost into your decision and consider whether your employer will sponsor the training. There are often more affordable alternatives available, especially for foundational knowledge, so carefully weigh the benefits and costs before investing in SANS certifications.
