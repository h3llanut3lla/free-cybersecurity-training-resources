# Free Trainings by Roles

It's important to understand that fully comprehensive, professional-level training courses are rarely offered completely free. Vendors often use free resources as a way to introduce their products or services. However, there are many free and low-cost resources that can help you develop the skills needed for various blue team roles. Here's a breakdown by role and the types of free training you can leverage.

## Security Analyst (Entry-Level/Junior)

* **Focus:** Monitoring, log analysis, threat intelligence research, basic incident response.
* **Free Training Resources:**
  * **Cybersecurity Fundamentals:** Start with free introductory courses on platforms like Cybrary ([cybrary.it](https://www.cybrary.it/)), Coursera (look for introductory courses), and edX ([edx.org](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E\&source=gmail\&q=https://www.edx.org/)). Focus on networking basics, security concepts, and operating system fundamentals.
  * **SIEM Training (Free Tiers/Trials):** Splunk (Fundamentals 1 - [splunk.com](https://www.splunk.com/)), Elastic (basic security courses - [elastic.co](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E\&source=gmail\&q=https://www.elastic.co/)) and other SIEM vendors often have free tiers or trials you can use for learning the basics of log analysis and event correlation.
  * **Threat Intelligence Platforms (Free Versions/Trials):** Many threat intelligence platforms have free versions or trials that allow you to explore how threat data is collected, analyzed, and used. Research individual platforms for their offerings.
  * **NIST Cybersecurity Framework Resources:** Familiarize yourself with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. NIST provides free publications and resources on security best practices. ([nist.gov](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E\&source=gmail\&q=https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework))
  * **NCSA and CISA Resources:** These organizations offer free guides and resources on various cybersecurity topics, including incident response and threat awareness. (NCSA: [staysafeonline.org](https://staysafeonline.org/), CISA: [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/))
  * **Practice Labs (Free/Low-Cost Options):** Try setting up a virtual lab environment using VirtualBox ([virtualbox.org](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E\&source=gmail\&q=https://www.virtualbox.org/)) or VMware Player ([vmware.com](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E\&source=gmail\&q=https://www.vmware.com/)). There are free vulnerable virtual machines available online (e.g., Metasploitable) that you can use for practice.

## Incident Responder

* **Focus:** Incident handling, containment, eradication, recovery, forensics.
* **Free Training Resources:**
  * **NIST Incident Handling Guide:** This is a must-read. NIST provides a comprehensive guide to incident response. ([nist.gov](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/cybersecurity-incident-handling-guide))
  * **SANS Institute (Free Resources):** SANS occasionally offers free webcasts and white papers on incident response topics. ([sans.org](https://www.sans.org/))
  * **Cybrary:** Look for free incident response courses on Cybrary. ([cybrary.it](https://www.cybrary.it/))
  * **Open Source DFIR Tools:** Learn to use open-source digital forensics and incident response tools like The Sleuth Kit (TSK) and Autopsy. There are many free tutorials available online.
  * **MITRE ATT\&amp;CK Framework:** Understand how to use the MITRE ATT\&amp;CK framework for mapping adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to incident response activities. ([mitre.org](https://www.mitre.org/))

## Threat Hunter

* **Focus:** Proactive threat searching, identifying advanced persistent threats (APTs), and improving security posture.
* **Free Training Resources:**
  * **MITRE ATT\&amp;CK Framework:** Mastering the MITRE ATT\&amp;CK framework is essential for threat hunting. ([mitre.org](https://www.mitre.org/))
  * **Cybersecurity Blogs and Research Papers:** Follow security researchers and companies who publish threat intelligence and hunting techniques.
  * **OSINT Resources:** Learn how to use open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques to gather information about potential threats.
  * **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Trials:** Many EDR vendors offer free trials that you can use to learn about threat hunting techniques in a real-world environment. (Be mindful of the limitations and sales focus.)
  * **Practice Labs:** Set up a virtual lab and practice threat hunting scenarios.

## Security Engineer

* **Focus:** Designing, implementing, and maintaining security infrastructure.
* **Free Training Resources:**
  * **Vendor-Specific Training (Free Tiers/Trials):** Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and security vendors (Cisco, Fortinet, etc.) offer free training on their products. While vendor-focused, the knowledge gained can be applied more generally.
  * **Networking Fundamentals:** A strong understanding of networking is crucial. Look for free networking courses or materials online.
  * **Security Certifications (Study Materials):** While certification exams cost money, many certification bodies (e.g., CompTIA, (ISC)Â²) offer free study guides and resources that can be helpful.
  * **OWASP Resources:** If you're focused on web application security, OWASP provides a wealth of free information. ([owasp.org](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://owasp.org/))

## Vulnerability Management Analyst

* **Focus:** Identifying, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities.
* **Free Training Resources:**
  * **NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD):** A great resource for vulnerability information. ([nvd.nist.gov](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E\&source=gmail\&q=https://nvd.nist.gov/))
  * **OpenVAS:** An open-source vulnerability scanner you can use to learn about vulnerability scanning.
  * **Nessus Essentials (Personal Use):** Tenable offers a free version of Nessus for personal use, which can be useful for learning. ([tenable.com](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.tenable.com/vulnerability-management/nessus-essentials))
  * **OWASP Vulnerabilities:** Learn about common web application vulnerabilities through OWASP resources. ([owasp.org](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://owasp.org/))
  * **SANS Institute (Free Resources):** SANS offers some free resources related to vulnerability management. ([sans.org](https://www.sans.org/))
  * **Vulnerability Scanning Tutorials:** Search for free tutorials and guides on how to use vulnerability scanning tool
