# Free Trainings by Roles

It's important to understand that fully comprehensive, professional-level training courses are rarely offered completely free. Vendors often use free resources as a way to introduce their products or services. However, there are many free and low-cost resources that can help you develop the skills needed for various blue team roles. Here's a breakdown by role and the types of free training you can leverage:

**1. Security Analyst (Entry-Level/Junior):**

* **Focus:** Monitoring, log analysis, threat intelligence research, basic incident response.
* **Free Training Resources:**
  * **Cybersecurity Fundamentals:** Start with free introductory courses on platforms like Cybrary, Coursera (look for introductory courses), and edX. Focus on networking basics, security concepts, and operating system fundamentals.
  * **SIEM Training (Free Tiers/Trials):** Splunk (Fundamentals 1), Elastic (basic security courses), and other SIEM vendors often have free tiers or trials you can use for learning the basics of log analysis and event correlation.
  * **Threat Intelligence Platforms (Free Versions/Trials):** Many threat intelligence platforms have free versions or trials that allow you to explore how threat data is collected, analyzed, and used.
  * **NIST Cybersecurity Framework Resources:** Familiarize yourself with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. NIST provides free publications and resources on security best practices.
  * **NCSA and CISA Resources:** These organizations offer free guides and resources on various cybersecurity topics, including incident response and threat awareness.
  * **Practice Labs (Free/Low-Cost Options):** Try setting up a virtual lab environment using VirtualBox or VMware Player. There are free vulnerable virtual machines available online (e.g., Metasploitable) that you can use for practice.

**2. Incident Responder:**

* **Focus:** Incident handling, containment, eradication, recovery, forensics.
* **Free Training Resources:**
  * **NIST Incident Handling Guide:** This is a must-read. NIST provides a comprehensive guide to incident response.
  * **SANS Institute (Free Resources):** SANS occasionally offers free webcasts and white papers on incident response topics.
  * **Cybrary:** Look for free incident response courses on Cybrary.
  * **Open Source DFIR Tools:** Learn to use open-source digital forensics and incident response tools like The Sleuth Kit (TSK), Autopsy, and Volatility. There are many free tutorials available online.
  * **MITRE ATT\&CK Framework:** Understand how to use the MITRE ATT\&CK framework for mapping adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to incident response activities.

**3. Threat Hunter:**

* **Focus:** Proactive threat searching, identifying advanced persistent threats (APTs), and improving security posture.
* **Free Training Resources:**
  * **MITRE ATT\&CK Framework:** Mastering the MITRE ATT\&CK framework is essential for threat hunting.
  * **Cybersecurity Blogs and Research Papers:** Follow security researchers and companies who publish threat intelligence and hunting techniques.
  * **OSINT Resources:** Learn how to use open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques to gather information about potential threats.
  * **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Trials:** Many EDR vendors offer free trials that you can use to learn about threat hunting techniques in a real-world environment. (Be mindful of the limitations and sales focus.)
  * **Practice Labs:** Set up a virtual lab and practice threat hunting scenarios.

**4. Security Engineer:**

* **Focus:** Designing, implementing, and maintaining security infrastructure.
* **Free Training Resources:**
  * **Vendor-Specific Training (Free Tiers/Trials):** Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and security vendors (Cisco, Fortinet, etc.) offer free training on their products. While vendor-focused, the knowledge gained can be applied more generally.
  * **Networking Fundamentals:** A strong understanding of networking is crucial. Look for free networking courses or materials online.
  * **Security Certifications (Study Materials):** While certification exams cost money, many certification bodies (e.g., CompTIA, (ISC)Â²) offer free study guides and resources that can be helpful.
  * **OWASP Resources:** If you're focused on web application security, OWASP provides a wealth of free information.
