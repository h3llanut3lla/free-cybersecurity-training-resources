# Welcome

[한국어 문서 바로가기](readme-1.md)

This is an open-source project that aims to uplift cybersecurity resilience by providing a curated list of free cybersecurity training resources. It’s designed for individuals who want to gain knowledge for entry roles in cybersecurity and small businesses and organisations looking to educate their new starters without ~~significant~~ financial investment. These resources cover various topics from blue team to red team and anything in between.

### Why Free Training Matters for Cybersecurity Resilience

Cybersecurity resilience isn’t just about technology; it’s about people. Well-trained individuals are the first line of defence against cyber threats. Free training resources democratize access to cybersecurity knowledge, empowering more people to:

* Identify and avoid common threats like phishing, malware, social engineering, etc.
* Practice good security hygiene
* Develop in-demand cybersecurity skills like incident response, vulnerability management, penetration testing, etc. (While fully comprehensive training often requires paid courses, hopefully, these resources can provide a foundation.)

### Curated Training Resources

This list is based on general knowledge of the cybersecurity field, widespread recognition within the community, and, in some cases, personal experience with the resources. It is regularly updated. Please feel free to contribute by submitting pull requests with additional resources.
